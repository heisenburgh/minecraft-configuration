# My Minecraft Configuration
This is a repository of my Minecraft 1.8.9 configurations configured for Hypixel minigames and leaderboard sweating. All mods are Hypixel legal and the Resource Pack used is Midnight 32x.

## Installation
- [] The installation for this is simple, either clone this repository through:
```git clone https://github.com/heisenburgh/minecraft-configuration```
**alternatively** click on the green colored *<> Code* button on this page. After that, click on the *Download Zip* button and download it to any directory that you want.

- [] Next, if you are on the Windows operating system, press ```Win+R``` to open the Run dialog box, then type ```%appdata%``` to open the AppData folder. Next, enter the ```.minecraft``` folder and copy the contents of *our downloaded Repository's* mods folder to *.minecraft's* mods folder. Also do the same for the resourcepacks folder.

-[] Next, replace *.minecraft's* ```settings.txt``` with my repository's ```settings.txt```

-[] For this last step, install Forge from the Forge website, or from CurseForge. 

-[] Open your Launcher and Launch the Minecraft profile with ```forge-1.8.9``` in it.
